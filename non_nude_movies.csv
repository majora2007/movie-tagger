A man makes a joke about being with two women (sex is not mentioned). Two sexual jokes are given.

We see a young man's bare chest when he lifts his shirt to show scratch and bite marks from a rat. A young man tries to find a place to hide a rat, that includes putting it down his pants (we see the waistband of his underwear).The French sensually in this will most likely go over kid's heads, nothing to worry about."

VeggieTales: The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's (2007)|

Power Rangers (2017)|"None. There are no sex or nudity shown in this movie. Some Sexual References Some Suggestive Content It is mentioned that Kimberly shared an explicit photo to her boyfriend with a crude remark about it, who in turn, shared it to the entire school. The photo is never seen, however. Two boys are heard talking about masturbating a bull; one boy mentions he milked her, but the other boy clarifies it's a ""him,"" and that ""one udder"" was in fact not an udder. It is mentioned that it was kind of big and took two hands (a hand motion is made). No action of this is shown, but the bull's erect penis is shown. The scene is non-sexual and is played for laughs. Kimberly takes off her t-shirt to reveal a bathing suit before diving into some water. The campfire scene starts with all of the rangers. This is where Trini the yellow ranger discusses her relationships, and the other asks if she has either boyfriend troubles or girlfriend troubles. Per the director this is inferring that she either is Lesbian or bi-sexual or it could also be interpreted as confused."

At a bar you can see a woman wearing a thong that is very revealing. You can almost see her bare butt but the scene is very brief and lasts about a second. There are also various other women throughout the movie who wear revealing clothing. Anakin and Padm� kiss passionately on a few occasions. There is some mild flirting between them. In bed, with every part of him below his chest covered by sheets, Anakin shirtless or naked is laying on his back.

One of the Members of Griff's gang asks Marty Junior ""Got no scrote?"", then grabs him by his groin and tosses him over the diner's counter. This could be considered molestation. Also considered Violence. In a alternate timeline, the main character's mother has had plastic surgery on her breasts to enlarge them. Only her cleavage is shown. A man heavily french kisses a woman who is not enjoying it. Several shots of women in their underwear, and stockings and suspenders in a 50's adult magazine. Very brief."
