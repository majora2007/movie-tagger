Sleeping Beauty (2011)|"Because this movie is based on a university girl who has to work for an exotic escort company there is quite a bit disturbing sexual acts done to the girl while she is asleep. An older man undresses as he watches a fully nude young woman sleeping (her bare buttocks are visible): he undresses to his boxer-style underwear and is shirtless, he turns over the sleeping young woman and makes a crude sexual remark (her bare breasts are visible), he takes off his boxers (his genitals are visible) and he mounts the young woman and uses crude language to describe how he will have sex with her; the young woman appears to continue to sleep as the man puts his hand in her mouth and licks her face. A woman explains to an elderly man that there should be ""no penetration"" and we see him undressing as he watches a young woman sleeping peacefully (his bare chest and his genitals are seen); he climbs into bed with the sleeping, nude young woman and he rests his head on her bare back. It is implied that a young man and a young woman are skinny dipping together (no nudity is visible): they are seen lying in bed together later (sex is implied and the young woman's bare breasts are visible), she gets up (we briefly see her bare buttocks) and dresses; the young man calls for the young woman to come back to bed and his bare chest visible. An older man takes off his shirt, and we see his bare chest and back as he pulls back the blankets covering a nude, sleeping young woman; the man lifts the young woman (her crotch area and bare breasts are visible), he drops her to the bed and lifts her again as she falls to the ground. A woman wearing breast-exposing lingerie and a garter belt without underwear seductively licks a man's finger as a young woman watches. We see women wearing lingerie that exposes their bare breasts, string bikinis and tight, high-waist garter belts without underwear (their crotch area and bare buttocks are visible). Women are seen wearing lingerie dresses that expose their bare breasts. We see the bare buttocks and crotch area of two women: they are kneeling on the ground as women wearing breast-exposing lingerie and no underwear (their crotch area is visible) drape their arms over a man and one woman's legs are draped around the man's waist. A young woman climbs out of bed and her bare breasts and crotch area are visible. A young woman sleeps in the nude, she rolls over and we see her bare breasts and buttocks as she stands and pulls on underwear. A young woman cries and opens her shirt to expose her bare breasts to an ill young man, and she climbs into bed next to the young man and he holds her close to him. A young woman undresses and we see her in lingerie. A young woman rolls up the hem of her dress to show a man her garter belt. A young woman wears a short dress, and she rolls up the hem reveling her upper thigh. We see a young woman lying on a table, she appears nude from the waist down (her bare upper thigh and hip are visible). A woman wears a low-cut top, partially unzipped to reveal cleavage. A woman wears a low-cut tank top that reveals cleavage. On multiple occasions we see a young woman wearing a barely closed robe that reveals cleavage. A woman instructs a young woman to strip (we see her in her underwear and bra), the woman calls in a man, who watches as the woman cups the young woman's breasts (covered by her bra), and circles the young woman, examining her; the man examines the young woman, running his hands over her legs and arms, and instructs the young woman to get dressed. A woman instructs a young woman to match her lipstick to the color of her crotch area; we later see the woman (it is implied that she pulled the young woman's underwear to the side) and then applies lipstick to the young woman's lips. An older man crudely tells a woman that he can only achieve sexual gratification from having fingers in his rectum and taking erectile dysfunction pills. A young woman tells a man, using crude language, that she would like to perform oral sex on him, and the man responds, ""Hallelujah."" A woman tells a young woman that she will not have penetrative sex while working as a prostitute and the young woman makes a crude remark about her genitals. A man tells a young woman that he and another man were debating who would sleep with her and she tells the man to flip a coin; the two men joke that they will toss a coin and the young woman is seen the next morning (it is implied that she stayed out the previous night, but it is not clear whether she had sex with either of the men)."

Showgirls (1995)|In one of the stripping scenes, there is a quick but explicit shot of Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley)'s vulva. A woman's buttocks was shown and a man walks up to her and fingers roughly Early in the movie, the lead actress (Elizabeth Berkley) is working at a Las Vegas strip club, so we see several fully-nude women, though most of the dancers are topless and wearing very skimpy thongs. In one of these scenes, a fully-nude stripper is crawling erotically on all fours across the stage, away from the camera, exposing her shadowed vulva to the camera. In most other scenes, shadows, trimmed pubic hair, or careful camera work conceal the woman's genitalia when we see full frontal nudity. There are occasional brief flashes of labia in these scenes, but they're easy to miss. No male genitalia are shown in this movie, even where opportunity would allow it. There are several shirtless and nude men in this movie, but where nude, we see them only from the rear or with posing or concealment that hides their genitalia. Several scenes show male buttocks. A woman gives a fully-clothed man a lap dance, during which she strips completely nude. At the climax of the dance, she vigorously dry humps him. It is implied that he has an orgasm. The bulk of the movie centers around a series of topless Las Vegas stage shows, so we see many scenes of bare-breasted women, both on-stage and backstage. In some of these scenes, the women are wearing little more than a thong. These topless stage shows are all erotic in some way. We see dance partners remove each others tops, caress each other, thrust their pelvises suggestively, etc. A man and woman dance suggestively together, him caressing her body, she rubbing that body against his. They begin to kiss erotically, and he pulls her top down, exposing her bared breasts with erect nipples. When he puts his hand down her pants, she warns him off, claiming her period. He doubts it, so she invites him to check. He pushes his hand deeper, then withdraws his hand and rubs his fingers together ruefully, realizing that she wasn't lying. A woman stands up from bed, shown completely nude from the rear. It is implied that she was having sex with a man shortly before this, who is seen wearing only a towel wrapped around his hips. A man and a woman strip nude and walk out to an outdoor swimming pool. We see the woman fully nude from the front and rear, and the man from the rear only. After a brief bit of skinny-dipping, the woman gives implied oral sex to the man underwater, then they copulate vigorously, then appear to achieve mutual orgasm. Water and the camera frame hide their bodies below the waist, but we see both of their bared torsos quite clearly. The next scene is set the morning after in the man's bedroom, implying that they had sex again that night. We see the couple nude, the man still in bed, the woman sitting on the edge of the bed getting dressed. We see the woman nude from the rear as she dresses, displaying bared breasts, back and buttocks, but no nipples. We see the man's bared torso from front and back, as well as his buttocks. The blankets cover the rest. Women kiss erotically in several scenes in this movie. Two of the female lead characters have a continuous back-and-forth sexual tension throughout the movie. A man bites a woman's erect nipples twice, then licks and sucks them in clear view of the camera.

Piranha 3D (2010)|As the underwater sequence ends, we see Riley climbing onto a boat fully naked. She shows her buttocks and her genital area can be seen from behind her buttocks. The shot is from far away but explicit The underwater sequence with Kelly Brook and Riley Steele is extremely explicit for an R-rated movie. Both girls show full frontal nudity, including their genitals for 3 minutes. There are multiple clear shots of their shaven genitals, sometimes showing their labia, especially Riley who gives multiple shots of her genital area in graphic detail. The scene basically shows every inch of the nude female form. A middle-schooler takes his girlfriend to the bathroom during a school field trip. They make out and the boy unzips the girl's bra and panties. Her breasts and genitals are seen. The boy then starts thrusting into her. It is shown from his backside, but the girl's breasts are seen. Lots of moaning. They stop when their teacher catches them. Kelly Brook and Riley Steele swim underwater fully nude (full-frontal nudity is seen on both, including genitals, bare buttocks and bare breasts); they swim suggestively while fondling each another's breasts, as two men watch, film them and make crude remarks and when they get out of the water their bare buttocks are seen in an extreme close-up. This scene is explicit and lasts for about 5 minutes. Two silicone bags (the implication is that they are breast implants torn from a woman's chest) float in water along with severed male genitalia; we see two fish fight over the male organ, and one swallows it and then spits it out (the image of the genitalia, bloody and deformed, fills the screen). On two occasions, a young man is seen watching a computer screen where multiple photographs of women's bare breasts are seen, and the sound of sexual moaning is heard. An extreme close-up of a young woman's bare breasts is seen on multiple occasions as she parasails behind a boat, and the young woman rubs her breasts suggestively as three men make crude remarks about her. A young woman rips off her shirt (her bare breasts are visible) as a man sprays her, and a dozen other young women, with water; they are wearing bikini bottoms and tight, nearly transparent wet T-shirts.

An electric cord whips through the air and cuts a young woman in half and her bikini top falls off exposing her bare breasts. The bare buttocks of three men are seen as they pull down their pants. On multiple occasions, countless young women wearing bikinis are seen dancing suggestively on boats, dancing with young women and young men, rubbing their hands over their bodies, thrusting their hips in a suggestive fashion and wearing stickers to cover their nipples when they dance without bikini tops. A man licks salt off a young woman's stomach and kisses her to get a lime from her mouth. A man instructs a young man to lick salt from a young woman's stomach and we see him lick her stomach and is about to kiss her until she sits up.

Even though being in a relationship with cousins is consisdered taboo nowadays. Back in the 18th century when the film is set it was perfectly normal and common for people to do this. This is a story of natural love, since the main characters are shipwrecked, even though the information displayed also here might be considered graphic or shocking. This is what would really happen if a situation like this would occur, since the characters don't know what love psyically or mentally is, since they were shipwrecked from a young age. A teenage girl has her first period. Being on a deserted island since youth, she did not understand what was happening. There are several sex scenes throughout the movie some more graphic then others, since Brooke Sheilds was a minor at the time the scenes are not overly graphic.

Throughout the film the two leads look at each other in light sexual ways, which the girl remarking how she was looking at his muscles, they also spy on each other.

There is explicit graffiti all over the main character's apartment lobby. The main character has a dream sequence about two bare-breasted women on each side of him as one feeds him grapes.

Eyes Wide Shut (1999)|"Heavy flirting, close slow dancing, and sexual talk between a man and a married woman. Nicole Kidman's bare butt is shown twice for reasonable time, including in the opening scene. Please note that the explicit sex scenes are not meant to titillate or arouse; love scenes are actually quite devoid of love, as there is very little moaning and essentially no intimacy. Scenes with sexual content or nudity are often accompanied by an eerie score and/or atmosphere. Despite the strong sexual content throughout and graphic nudity at times, the material is presented in an artful form, showing the negative side to lust with no intention of humor or raunch, but instead providing a disturbing and creepy atmosphere. The sexual activity in most scenes is obscured by objects or people. Most sexual activity in the orgy scene is in the background, as the viewer watches Tom Cruise's character walk through the party. Many explicit sex scenes are depicted. A private party has several moments involving orgy scenes (in the American version, explicit sex is obscured by digital means), including continuous full-frontal female nudity and several other instances of naked men. Other strong sex scenes involving male/female, male/male, and female/female that include rough sex and thrusting are shown (explicit sexual activity is obscured in the American version). During the above mentioned party, much nudity is shown. For example, early in the party, twelve women in a circle all disrobe and are wearing only masks and thongs, their breasts clearly visible. The women then walk to men, ""kiss"" them (basically touching masks), and escort them out of the main room. They are shown walking around in only the mask and thong. In the orgy scene, many woman are shown fully naked and in sexual situations; full frontal female nudity is often shown, all with masks on. As mentioned elsewhere, in the American version all direct intercourse in the party is blocked by a person standing in the way. There is also a very brief scene with couples slow-dancing where at least one member of each couple is naked, sometimes both. There are depictions of full-frontal female nudity (more prevalent) and male nudity (mostly from behind, but some full-frontal). A store owner's daughter (possibly a minor) is prostituted out to older men (no nudity, but sex is strongly suggested). This is shown across two scenes: in the first, the store owner discovers the girl with the two Asian men, all three in underwear; It may be important to note the men are wearing makeup, or are in drag. In the second scene, the three are shown exiting a back room, implying that they have had sex. A woman undresses in front of a mirror. Full-frontal nudity is shown in the mirror, but it is blurry and brief. A woman is shown unconscious on a couch after a drug overdose, full-frontal nudity shown briefly. A doctor examines a female patient. Her breasts are clearly visible. There are three brief sex scenes with the Kidman character shown as black and white flashbacks by the Cruise character, with nothing explicit shown. There are two scenes where Tom Cruise's character visits a prostitute. In the first, they end up not having sex, though it is discussed. In the second scene, her roommate is there and Cruise opens her top and feels her breasts, though no nudity is shown. A scene shows a dead woman in a morgue; her naked body is shown."

Riddick (2013)|Theatrical: Four women are in a bed naked. We see one breast and nipple of a woman, her stomach, legs and most importantly full frontal.

Extended: This entire scene is slightly prolonged with a much longer shot of the nude women on the bed with vagina completely visible; This only lasts a few seconds longer, & one of the women walks away from the bed towards Riddick, with her butt fully visible behind her clothing (brief).

Combined the scenes last for a few seconds. A character mentions his intent to have sex (in the context of the dialogue rape is implied) with her and then mentions watching her while she showered. A few crude sexual references are made. A male character pins a female character to the floor and licks her face. There is clear intention of rape although the scene ends shortly thereafter. Sexual innuendos and crude references are made periodically throughout the move. A man tells a woman in front of her male team members that she should have sex with a male prisoner. The next day one of the men states that he will have sex with the woman. There are several moments where dialogue either implicitly or explicitly implies rape. There is no actual sexual encounters in the movie - only references, crude dialog and a lengthy scene of nudity.

Shame (2011)|A lot of graphic sex, although you never see the penis enter the vaginal. The film opens with a man walking around his apartment completely nude.

The men end up arguing because they do not want their penises to touch while having sex with her.

Several instances of erect penises displayed in full view. In one scene, the main character performs unsimulated oral sex on a man.
