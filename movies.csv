Allegiant (2016)|The film contains a sequence depicting a woman going through a decontamination process, where full rear nudity of the woman can be seen, although the scene is very dark, so it's hard to see many details.

He offers to go out on a date with her and have some sex, but she punches him in the groin.NOT appropriate for under 14s!

Full-frontal and pubic hair is shown.A man does a handstand and his bare butt is seen.A group of men and women run through the woods and wade through a river in the nude. Again, nonsexual and completely obscured by shadowsMoaning sounds of a woman while kissing can be heard. Nothing is seen.A woman is seen jumping from a stair.

This can be unsettling for some viewers.A group of soldiers watch a woman lying with her skirt lifted slightly and some of her thigh showing.A lunatic woman pees while standing inside a monastery with her clothes on.A man kisses another man on the lips at the coronation. This isn't sexual because in a historical context it was just another formality for the Russians.A general remark on all this: all of the nudity scenes are in a 11 minute segment of the movie; and although the descriptions make it seem like there is a lot of nudity being shown, the final effect is very mild, mostly used in a non-sexual manner, since the director, Tarkovsky, was a very conservative Catholic.

Anna (2013)|

Anna Karenina (2012)|"Anna's affair and initial attraction with Vronsky begins with a dance (somewhat sensual) at a ball. Anna finally falls for him, and they consummate their relationship. Their sex scene isn't as explicit as one would expect; we see both their bare shoulders and Vronsky's torso, and several close up views of their faces as they passionately kiss and move sexually; all during a montage of Anna going to his house for this encounter.Another scene shows the couple clothed, lying in a forest (at a picnic), and after some suggestive dialogue, Anna climbs on top of Vronsky and begins to move slowly, sensually, and explicitly, as he responds. There are also close ups of Anna licking Vronsky's lips and face, as they begin to have sex and the scene fades out.We see Vronsky nude from the side briefly (his backside is seen partially) as he lies next to a nude Anna (who is covered by bedsheets).Sexual dialogue is present throughout the script, as Oblonsky admits to having affairs outside of his marriage, and a man lives with a prostitute, saying she is his wife. Costumes reveal cleavage, and Anna is briefly seen changing (we see her bare upper back). A woman is seen breastfeeding a baby, although this is very brief and doesn't reveal much nudity. Anna is called a ""slut"" in front of many people. Karenin takes out a box several times during the movie which looks like it contains a reusable condom. It may imply that he and Anna have sex."

Dildos and other sexual paraphernalia are seen clearly throughout the shop, and the man is transfixed on a Japanese vintage doll, that realistically depicts the female anatomy, with upper frontal nudity visible on one half.The main protagonist gives the toy to his son later, where he comments that something is being secreted out of it, and his mother says it is ""just a liquid""."
